This is just a playground type project for me to test things out with Docker and Django.

It allows me to automatically create required passwords in the `.env` file.
Also checks that certain required variables are set.
Not meant to be used in any production environment. Useful for local development.

Run with:
```
touch .env
docker-compose up
```

Test
